Code Contribution Practices
---------------------------
* Please _do not_ use the __master__ branch; instead, use the next release branch
* Contributions will only be accepted as __pull requests__
* If you plan on taking on an [Issue](https://github.com/mcongrove/ChariTi/issues), leave a comment so no one else duplicates your work
* Be sure to pull the lastest code before submitting a pull request; conflicting merges may be rejected
* Poorly written or inefficient contributions will be rejected; it's not personal, we still love you
* If you follow the coding standards established in our existing code, we'll love you even more

Where do I start?
-----------------
You can either visit the [Issues](http://github.com/mcongrove/ChariTi/issues) page and pick an un-assigned issue from an upcoming branch, or you can submit a new issue with any features you'd like to see added. We're certainly open to ideas from the community!

If you choose to create your own issue with a new feature, please be sure it isn't already listed. Also, please do not add any tags (priority or issue type). We'll review the issue and tag it appropriately; it's sort of our way of signing off on your idea.

Can I be a contributor?
-----------------------
After you've submitted a couple of pull requests you can ask to be added as a contributor. We'd like to make sure that contributors are following the guidelines first.

What if I want to help with the ChariTi website?
